Hello!
Welcome to Web Code! This is an exciting time to get on board, as we have some new
projects coming in, such as Amazing Events.
The idea is to develop the app from scratch, but first I’ll need you to send us some
exercises on JavaScript to see your abilities in the language.
You come to us as an HTML/CSS expert, so I know I want you on this project. I’m still
working with Amazing Events to clarify just what they’d like us to do for them. I’m
meeting with them this week, so I’ll have more detail soon.
While I work with AE I’d like you to send me a GitHub repository with a model of the site
based on the wireframe we sent you. Feel free to choose your color palette and make
any design changes that will upgrade the app without losing content.
Thanks,
Paula Davis
